This directory contains the fonts from the Noto project, chosen for
Android. For more detail about Noto, please refer to:

https://code.google.com/p/noto/

The tagline is: "Fonts support all languages/characters in Unicode"

The above is the authoritative repository for the fonts. This directory
does not necessarily track it exactly, and contains only the fonts
needed for Android (the unhinted versions in particular, if both hinted
and unhinted versions are available, for size reasons), so does not
include any utilities or installers.
