1) Creating an OTA zip

# Add your update files to the update folder following the folder structure described below

META-INF/
    +- com/
       +- google/
             +- android/
                   +- update-binary
                   +- updater-script (custom update script)
system/ 
   +- (Update files)
data/ 
   +- (Update files)

# The update-script is where all the update logic is. It is written in the Edify scripting language. Refer previous releases for examples.

# Run get_built_binaries.sh to get latest update-binary and signapk.jar. If you are on the "user" branch, the update-binary won't be built automatically. You can either manually build it get it from : https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-vV81AxHSyfWmdCVEJta0ZRSE0

# Create unsigned zip using 
cd update
zip -9r ../unsigned.zip * -x system/.gitignore

# Run the following to create the signed update
java -jar signapk.jar -w release.x509.pem release.pk8 unsigned.zip update.zip

2) Enabling automatic updates

# Open the file device/ti/beagleboard/updateInfo.xml and udate the "maxUpdateId" and "checksum" values for the target base versions. This is how the update clients know that there is a new update available.

# Create a release commit and tag : e.g. https://github.com/b2gdev/Android-JB-4.1.2/commit/3541f8c28b9cce2b36c4c35de2d88d0f321f5b49 

# Create a Github release for the new tag and attach the OTA zip to it : e.g. https://github.com/b2gdev/Android-JB-4.1.2/releases
