 *  Purpose:   Include file for typedefs required in the Sierra
 *             Wireless portion of the system. Third party code
 *             may not follow this standard.
 *
 *  Note:      These definitions are for use in the internal
 *             portion of the API. The definitions used by the public
 *             part are defined separately.
 *
 *             Do not add any definitions to this file. All new definitions
 *             should go into SwiDataTypes.h
