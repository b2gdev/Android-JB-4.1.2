 * Name:    icsmtcb
 *
 * Purpose: Structure that implements a shared-memory an inter-task
 *          messaging facility.
 *
 * Members: icsmtputp    - Location to put the next message to
 *          icsmtgetp    - Location to get the next message from
 *          icsmtstartp  - Pointer to the start of the message area
 *          icsmtendp    - Pointer to the last entry in the msg area
 *          icsmtqnamep  - Pointer to a caller-supplied string
 *          icsmtrcvcnt  - counts received messages since reset
 *          icsmtsendcnt - counts messages that has been sent since reset
 *          icsmtmaxqueued - maximum messages that were on  a queue
 *          icsmtwaiter  - Waiter structure. Allows the thread that
 *                         owns this structure to block waiting for
 *                         incoming messages
 *          issmtsem     - Semaphore structure used by callers to
 *                         obtain exclusive access to this structure
 *          mstimeout      signal the registered client periodically every
 *                         mstimeout seconds.
 *          msruntime      running count-down of mstimeout
 *
 * Notes:   For use by threads within the SDK process only
 *
 *          Later when this SDK needs to support 64 bit architectures,
 *          another declaration for the pointers below will be needed.
 *          This can wait until the next release when we have time to
 *          fix this properly
