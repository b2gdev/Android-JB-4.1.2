 * Name:        IC Package User Information
 * 
 * Purpose:     The IC package provides facilities for tasks to 
 *              communicate with one another. A task may be either 
 *              a process or a thread, the IC package provides 
 *              facilities for both types to exchange information. 
 *
 *              For the purposes of this package, it is sufficient
 *              to identify processes as tasks which do not have 
 *              shared memory, these are referred to as "user-mode
 *              tasks" whenever a distinction is required. In the 
 *              absence of shared memory another mechanism is required
 *              for user-mode tasks to communicate with each other and
 *              this package hides the details of that mechanism from 
 *              its users. 
 *
 *              Threads exist in a shared-memory environment and this
 *              package refers to them as "shared memory tasks" whenever
 *              the distinction is important. 
 *
 *              The source files for this package have two naming 
 *              conventions applied:
 *              
 *              icsmt_sdk.c - Code in support of inter-task communication
 *                            for shared memory tasks. Not available for
 *                            use in the application
 *              icipc_sdk.c - Code in support of inter-task communication
 *                            between user-mode tasks. This source file 
 *                            contains code for the SDK-side
 *              icipc_app.c   Code in support of inter-task communication
 *                            between user-mode tasks. This source file
 *                            contains code for the Application side
 *                
 *                
 * Entry Points:
 * 
 *       Shared memory entry points:
 *       ==========================
 *       icsmt_create() - Create and initialize a shared memory
 *                        inter-task message structure
 *       icsmt_send()   - Send an inter-task message to another
 *                        shared memory task
 *       icsmt_rcv()    - Receive an inter-task message, blocking
 *                        until one is available or a timeout
 *
 * Testing:  Testing is done via the ictestxxx executable, where xxx 
 *           refers to the processor type. e.g. ictest386 is the
 *           executable for a PC architecture. 
 *           
 *           Details of the test are located in the Notes section
 *           of the file ictest.c. Essentially an SMT inter-task
 *           message is ping-ponged between two threads and the 
 *           output is sent to the system log file. Note that the
 *           SDK process startup code is used for the test, although
 *           it's not really the SDK running. It was needed to 
 *           provide a context in which to create the threads
 *          
 * Limitations:
 *          
 * NOTE:        None
