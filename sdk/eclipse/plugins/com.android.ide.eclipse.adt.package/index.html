    <p>The <b>Android Developer Tools</b> provide a first-class development
    environment for building Android apps. This integrated development environment is
    set up with the latest version of the Android platform and system image so you can immediately begin
    building apps and running them on the Android emulator.</p>
    
    
    <p>To start a new Android app project:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click <strong>File > New > Android Application Project</strong>.
     	<br>(If you don't see this option, click <strong>File > New > Other</strong>,
			then open the <strong>Android</strong>
      	folder and select <strong>Android Application Project</strong>.)</li>
      <li>Follow the wizard to set up your new Android app project.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For a complete walkthrough that shows how to create a new
		project and build a simple app, read <a target="_blank"
    href="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html">Building Your First App</a>.</p>
    
    <p>To set up a real Android device for testing your app, read
    <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html">Using Hardware Devices</a>.
    If you don't have a device and need to use the emulator, read <a
	 target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/index.html"
      >Managing Virtual Devices</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Although your Android SDK already includes the latest version of the platform and system image,
    you may later want to install other Android versions or packages such as the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html">Android Support Library</a>.
    For help installing additional packages, read
