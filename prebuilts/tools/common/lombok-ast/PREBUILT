The source code for the classes in this prebuilt can
be found in the src.zip in this directory.

The objects in this prebuilt directory can also be
rebuilt using the source archive hosted at

http://projectlombok.org/

Specifically, changeset 3c4f94d418b58d55d0facebf2bfbb362d4bf3bdd
from
https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok.ast

NOTE 1: The 0.2.1 bits were patched by this CL:
https://github.com/tnorbye/lombok.ast
which basically adds an extra field to the nodes to track
the original source AST node. The lombok-ast-0.2.1-src.zip
includes these diffs.

NOTE 2: Lombok.AST was combined with Guava 13.0.1 to match
what is used in the rest of the tools, and Guava was also
removed from the lombok binary (which by default jarjar's it
into the lombok.jar), since it will always be used in a
context where Guava is already ready, so no point in bundling
a private copy.
